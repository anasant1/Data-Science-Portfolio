# Data-Science-Portfolio
Welcome! My name is Ana Santiago, and I'm a master's student at the University of Washington, pursuing a degree in Information Management, specializing in Data Science. The following folders contain coursework and independent projects that demonstrate my programming skills in Python, and SQL, as well as my data analysis abilities, statistical and machine learning knowledge, and storytelling capacities through data. 

## Table of contents:
1. __In-progress: Movie-recommender__
2. Programming-for-DS
3. SQL-queries
4. Seattle-Crime-09-19
5. __In-progress: relational-database-management__


### Folder overview
The folders containing coursework at UW are: 'Programming-for-DS', 'SQL-queries', and 'relational-database-management' 
The programming for DS folder contains Python-specific work demonstrating my data processing skills, as well as application of supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. The SQL queries folder demonstrates my ability to construct complex queries to retrieve data from a database, which further demonstrates my understanding of entity relationship diagrams, and ability to navigate to the pertinent tables containing the information sought. Lastly, the relational-database-management folder contains work in building a mcok database for a bakery business. This folder contains SQL files, as well as PNG and PDF files that illustrate my Entity-Relationship diagramming knowledge, as well as my navigation through the logical and conceptual stages of database creation. 

The independent projects I have pursued at my own direction are in the Seattle Crime 09-19, and Movie recommender folders. 
The former is a completed project that demonstrates my EDA skills, as well as statistical knowledge for interpreting data. I chose to work with this project because, as a Seattle resident, I was curious to see whether the data backed the negative media portrayal of safety in the city. This project incorporates secondary data sources from data.seattle.gov, and entailed extensive data processing techniques. 
The latter project is in progress. The folder currently contains my web-scraper building process to obtain information from the Rotten Tomatoes website to analyze critic and audience scores with the ultimate goal of building a simple movie-recommender chatbot.
