Hi!
In this folder you will find a mock relational database I instantiated during a course I took during the spring term 2024 of my master's program at UW. I followed the SDLC phases, except for Maintenance as this was outside of thr scope of the course:
1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Build
   
In this project, I navigated through the 3 levels of database design and 3-level architecture stages:
1. Conceptual
2. Logical
3. Physical
