Hi!
In this folder you will find a mock relational database I instantiated during a course I took during the spring term 2024 of my master's program at UW. I followed the SDLC phases, except for Maintenance as this was outside of thr scope of the course:
1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Build
   
In this project, I navigated through the 3 levels of database design and 3-level architecture stages:
1. Conceptual model
2. Logical model
3. Physical model

I brainstormed the business nouns with a franchised bakery business context, and transformed those to an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) that I refined from 1NF to 3NF before instantiating my database, populating its tables, and adding mock data to its lookup tables. 
** My 3NF ERD can be found here: relational-database-management/ERD's/AnaSantiago_3NF-ERD.jpg **

Finally, I coded triggers, stored procedures for business transactions, computed columns, and a couple of complex query examples. 
This project demonstrates my ability to utilize data manipulation language (DML), data definition language (DDL), and data control language (DLC). 

## The .sql file containing this code can be found here: relational-database-management/db-creation-instantiation/AnaSantiago_db-procedures.sql

For a brief overview of the process, please peruse the .pdf file of my slide deck here: relational-database-management/AnaSantiago_RDBMS-presentation.pdf
