Welcome! This folder contains assignments I completed during my master's Data Science courses, demonstrating my Python coding abilities to
clean data, understand it, visualize it, fit a model, and evaluate a model's performance. 

For IMT573, I decided to upload my final assignment Jupyter Notebook as it demonstrates my Python skills for data preprocessing, statistical analysis through Exploratory Data Analysis, and appropriate regression model selection and interpretation.
For IMT574 Machine Learning course, I uploaded each separate notebook I worked on during the term that highlight specific machine learning algorithm applications and interpretations.
