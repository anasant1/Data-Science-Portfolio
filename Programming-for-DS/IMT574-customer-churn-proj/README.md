The final project for my Machine Learning course was a group assignment in which my team members and I selected a dataset to solve a business problem of our choosing.
We decided to work with the IBM Telco dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset
My team members were Ryuya Sekido and Cole Thorpen.
