Welcome!

This movie recommender project is in progress. The first part of the project involved building a web scraper to mine data from Rotten Tomatoes to collect data on specific movies available on streaming services in 2024. 
Consequent updates to the .ipynb file will contain data processing, including NLP tokenization of words such as genres, and descriptions. Afterward, I will conduct EDA to familiarize myself further with the data structures, and implement proper statistical analysis to select the appropriate ML algorithms to build a simple recommender chatbot.
